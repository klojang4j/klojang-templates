# Klojang Templates

_**Klojang Templates**_ is a Java templating API written with two goals in mind:

1. Writing templates should be so simple that there is essentially no learning curve.
2. Provide a rich en flexible API for populating the templates that more than
   compensates for their simplicity. 

In short: leverage the skills of Java
   programmers, rather than make them learn what, in effect, amounts to a whole new
   language.
