# Klojang Templates

_Klojang Templates_ is a Java templating API written with two goals in mind:

1. Writing templates should be so simple that there is essentially no learning curve.
2. Provide a rich en flexible API for populating the templates that more than
   compensates for their simplicity.

In short: leverage the skills of Java programmers, rather than make them learn what,
in effect, amounts to a whole new language. This solidly places _Klojang Templates_
in the _Zero Logic Templates_ camp of templating approaches, alongside, for example,
[Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) and on opposite sides of a template engine
like [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/).

Klojang templates arguably are even simpler than Mustache templates. There are just
five syntactical constructs. Three if you discount for the fact that two of them are
comments-like constructs. Two if you consider that of those three, two are
functionally equivalent (the API user cannot tell whether one construct was used or
the other). Nevertheless, populating a template can be done very efficiently and
elegantly due to a rather unique feature: nested templates.

One appealing feature of Thymeleaf is that the raw, unprocessed templates render just
as well within a browser as the output generated by the Thymeleaf engine. This allows
the static HTML mockups produced by designers to evolve into fully dynamic pages
while at no point entering an "unrenderable" phase. If your company has the financial
and human resources to care about this, _Klojang Templates_ also allows you to create
templates that will render just fine in their raw state.
